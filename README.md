# Dev Connector

Built using the MERN stack, this app allows users to register, login, create a profile, add details to their profile, view other users' profiles, and post global messages and comments. Features: Redux, validation, Json Web Token, and more.

This was a project from a Udemy course to learn how to connect Node and React. Be on the look out for some original MERN apps on my profile very soon.
